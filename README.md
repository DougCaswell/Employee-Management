This app, The Employee Management App, is being created to fulfill the scope of a coding challenge I have recieved.  See instructions below.

I ended up using some testing and PostgreSQL for the bonus sections



CRUD Coding Challenge

 

Congratulations on making it through the first-round of screening. Your resume was impressive. We'd like to see your coding skills, but we don't believe in white boarding. In fact, did you know that most developers don't write more than 5-6 lines of codes without referencing documentation, Googling, Stack Overflowing etc.? So, we don't expect you to do it for us under pressure. Instead, we have a brief assignment for you.

 

Instructions:

 

- Create a simple CRUD application in React.

- Use Sass for easy and quick CSS.

- When you're done, deploy your code to a hosting site.

- We are mostly looking to see your coding style, an eye for design and coding best practices (refactoring, semantic/clean code, dry, etc.).

- Imagine another developer is going to pick up your codebase and work on it at a later date.

- Bonus points if you use Hooks, MySQL or TDD.

 

The Application:

 

You're creating an ultra-simplified employee management app. Our application needs to be able to:

- Add new employees (C)

- View all current employees in a simple table (R)

- Update employee details (U)

- Delete employees that leave the company (D)

 

For each employee, the HR manager needs to see the following attributes in a simple table:

- Employee ID number

- First name

- Last name

- Email address

- Phone number

 

That's it. Other than that, feel free to get creative.
